Customizable bot for streamers


# Bot Usage
<details>
<summary>First Launch</summary>

For your first launch, you will need:
* Install all required libraries (I guess this one is kind of obvious)
* A [Discord Token](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html)
* A [Twitch Token](https://twitchio.dev/en/latest/quickstart.html#tokens-and-scopes)
* A [.env file](https://dev.to/jakewitcher/using-env-files-for-environment-variables-in-python-applications-55a1) inside `./configurations/` (making it `./configurations/.env`)

Your *.env* file must look (at least) something like this:
```env
discord_token = "MTA0O.I.Swear.g25Nj.This.Is.h7xV.AxHsBbXCpa.A.Real.if7a1GlhoxUyt.Token.68xYAoQ"
twitch_token = "xkABcx.Another.Real.Token.xHbXgi18xzAyGH"
```
After you have all of that ready, you should be good to go and just run your `main_run.py` to get going :)
